# Note Page 
A react to-do app, where users can register and track their tasks.

## Tasks 
- Set a database and figure out all of our values (task name, date added, due date, priority level, notes, completion status )
- Create the task list
- Create a chart or some sort of visual that show how many tasks completed/not completed
- Ability to add notes to tasks
- Today's tasks page, upcoming task page
- UI similar to Google Keep/ Google Tasks? 
- Refer to project board 
 

## Other things to keep in mind
- GOTTA MAKE IT POP
- npm install axios
- npm install @mui/icons-material
- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

## Some of Leigh's Notes
-Add content to info page
-Work on readme
-Don't forget to remove all excess code in each component and any excess files
-remove bold text on task name on edit task form 
-add some spacing between the header and nav on edit form after the code is pushed. Also need to change the start date text to shrink.
-Struggling to figure out the hover effect on MUI buttons and icons.. there is a super subtle effect currently but I need to figure out how and where to override that.
